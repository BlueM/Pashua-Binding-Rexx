Overview
===========

This is a Rexx language binding (glue code) for using [Pashua](http://www.bluem.net/jump/pashua) with Rexx. Pashua is a Mac OS X application for using native GUI dialog windows in various programming languages.

This code can be found in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/BlueM/Pashua-Binding-Rexx. For examples in other programming languages, see https://github.com/BlueM/Pashua-Bindings.

Usage
======
This repository contains a single source file (`example.rexx`), which contains code for handling the communication with Pashua as well as an example dialog.


Compatibility
=============
This code requires Regina 3.2 or 3.3.

It is compatible with Pashua 0.10. It will work with earlier versions of Pashua, but non-ASCII characters will not be displayed correctly, as any versions before 0.10 required an argument for marking input as UTF-8.


Author
